# manager
Lets create something.

# Setup
0. Create Github account.
1. Ask to join our team.
2. Download Github client.
3. Download XAMPP and Set it up [XAMPP Tutorials](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=setting+up+xampp+on+windows)
4. Open XAMMP and click Explorer. This should open up a window where your copy of XAMPP was installed.
5. Open the htdocs folder. This is where all the web files are stored.
6. Fork this repository /xampp/htdocs/ folder. [Forking Examples](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=setting+up+git+repository)
7. Once you have properly forked the repo it should create a folder called manager in your /xampp/htdocs/ folder.
8. From here you can edit code using the Explorer button from the XAMPP program. I like to use [Notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/download/) to edit my files.
9. After you edit your files, you can go to your Git Hub client and commit the code to the repo.
10. Once that is done, it is a joyous day! Now we can all see the files you submitted to the repo! Congratulations!

# Viewing the Manager Web Code
After you have apache running and depending on your XAMPP setup, you should be able to view the manager website I created by going to either:
[localhost:8080/manager/](http://localhost:8080/manager/) or [localhost:/manager/](http://localhost/manager/)

# What is Git Hub?
Git Hub is a repository in the cloud. It allows users to submit code to the repo from any computer in the world.

# What is a Repository (Repo)?
A repository is a place where all code is kept in a project. Think of a repo as a file system. A file system that records all user submissions and is a way to keep code and files organized.

# What is XAMMP?
XAMPP acts as a web server running on your home PC.

The goal of XAMPP is to build an easy to install distribution for developers to get into the world of Apache. To make it convenient for developers, XAMPP is configured with all features turned on. [Taken from their website -Jan 2016-](https://www.apachefriends.org/about.html)
